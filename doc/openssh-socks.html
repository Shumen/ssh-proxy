            Tested on Linux Mandrake 8.1, this will not affect you providing
  you   have  RPM support. This guide applys to other internet applications
 as well.             
<h3> Introduction</h3>
             The SOCKS firewall protocol was fostered by NEC, they currently
  <b>DO  NOT</b>   support a free version of their tools for UNIX (free as 
 in freedom, not beer). Many applications   directly  support  the SOCKS 4/5
 protocols, Netscape, Opera etc. The NEC  software was previously available 
  at <a href="ftp://ftp.nec.com/pub/socks/socks5"> ftp://ftp.nec.com/pub/socks/socks5</a>
         before, now it is not. However there are other free solutions available
    now, which means you have choices. (The way of UNIX)<br>
            <br>
            There are 5 solutions covered in this SSH through a SOCKS PROXY 
 guide.<br>
            <br>
            Currently I use Goto-san's connect.c and the wrapper "runsocks" 
 for   other   applications, read this whole FAQ before making your decision! 
             
<h4> 1) Using the old NEC software</h4>
             The packages NEC previously made available on Linux were rpm/tgz 
  packages     that implemented the server, <br>
            client programs and a wrapper program (for programs without compiled
    in  SOCKS support). <br>
            <a
 href="http://rpmfind.net/linux/rpm2html/search.php?query=socks"> http://rpmfind.net/linux/rpm2html/search.php?query=socks</a><br>
            <br>
            I installed runsocks-1.0r11-3.i386.rpm successfully.<br>
            rpm -ivh<br>
         <br>
            I have also rpm --rebuild the src.rpm to make the whole packages
  and   installed   those as well. <br>
            <br>
            i rebuilt the source downloaded from<br>
           <a
 href="ftp://rpmfind.net/linux/falsehope/home/gomez/socks5/">  ftp://rpmfind.net/linux/falsehope/home/gomez/socks5/</a><br>
            (sometimes this site not available, try later and it might work,
  anyone    know why?)<br><a href="http://plf.zarb.org/rpm/8.2/i586/">http://plf.zarb.org/rpm/8.2/i586/</a> is another link.
            <br>
            Do this in your shell <br>
            $ export SOCKS4_SERVER = mysocks4server<br>
         <br>
         Or you can specify it in the conf file as follows.<br>
         <br>
            Create this file /etc/libsocks5.conf<br>
            <br>
            $ cat /etc/libsocks5.conf <br>
            socks4 - - - - mysocks4server <br>
            <br>
            There are problems with this<br>
           <br>
            You have to be root to use runsocks ssh -l myusername &lt;host&gt;
   or  you will get the  <br>
            following error: <br>
           <br>
           $ runsocks ssh -l myuser myhost.com <br>
            ssh: error while loading shared libraries: libsocks5_sh.so: cannot
   open   <br>
            shared object file: No such file or directory <br>
           <br>
           DNS does not work, you get this error from ssh <br>
            $ su <br>
           <br>
           $ runsocks ssh -l youruser yourhost.com <br>
            ssh: yourhost.com: Temporary failure in name resolution <br>
           <br>
           The only way to connect is to be root and also use the IP. I can 
 connect,     its just not good practice to have to be root and use the IP 
 address! Also you need to change the suid bit on the /usr/bin/ssh, type chmod
755. Wrapping suid is not allowed as a cracker could then get root on your
system!<br>
           <br>
           Read the man pages for libsocks5.conf and runsocks for further 
information.       <br>
           <br>
           These are the versions I have, I do not have ftp space to host 
them,    if  anyone  has perminant ftp space for them please contact me. (I
believe    we  are allowed to distribute them under the licence) I download 
them from    places  such as <a
 href="ftp://rpmfind.net/linux/falsehope/home/gomez/socks5/">  ftp://rpmfind.net/linux/falsehope/home/gomez/socks5/</a><br>
           <br>
           runsocks-1.0r11-3.i386.rpm<br>
          socks-4.3.beta2-2.i386.rpm<br>
           socks-4.3.beta2-2.src.rpm<br>
           socks5-1.0r11-3.i386.rpm<br>
           socks5-1.0r11-3.src.rpm<br>
           socks5-clients-1.0r11-3.i386.rpm<br>
           socks5-devel-1.0r11-3.i386.rpm<br>
           export.socks.4.3.beta2.tar.gz<br>
           export.socks.cstc.4.2.2.tar.gz<br>
           socks.cstc.4.2.2.tar.gz             
<h4> 2) Use Goto-san's connect.c (works transparently)</h4>
             OpenSSH SOCKS support was removed from the OpenSSH implementation
   on  2000-02-07,   using SSH through SOCKS firewalls is now ONLY supported
   using  a ProxyCommand   from within the SSH configuration files.<br>
           <br>
           I found how to use OpenSSH through socks.  <br>
           <br>
           a) Download and compile this URL's source code. And put the binary 
  in  your   path.  <br>
          <a href="http://www.imasy.or.jp/%7Egotoh/connect.c"> http://www.imasy.or.jp/~gotoh/connect.c</a><br>
           <br>
        $ su<br>
           $ gcc -o sconnect connect.c <br>
            $ cp sconnect /usr/local/bin  <br>
           <br>
           b) Add the following line in your ssh_config, this is for a SOCKS4 
  server.  Read his source for futher infomation.<br>
         <br>
         ProxyCommand /usr/local/bin/sconnect -4 -S your-socks-server:1080
 %h  %p   <br>
           <br>
           That's it! Everything should work now  <br>
           <br>
           This is the <i>best</i> solution IMO.  <br>
            <br>
                     
<h4>  3) Use the proprietary SSH.com trial version</h4>
             Only possible for non-commercial 30 day use, supports the SOCKS
  protocol.                
<p>export SSH_SOCKS_SERVER=socks://youruser@socks-server:1080/x.x.x.0/24 </p>
                       
<p>I gave up on proprietary solutions so I have not tested futher. SSH.com 
    is not open source, thus I would only use it in "legacy" systems that 
required    it.</p>
                       
<h4> 4) Dante OSS version</h4>
             This has not been tested, but i have received good feedback
about    it. See <a href="http://www.inet.no/dante/">http://www.inet.no/dante/</a>
      for  further information or <a
 href="http://rpmfind.net/linux/rpm2html/search.php?query=dante">     http://rpmfind.net/linux/rpm2html/search.php?query=dante</a><br>
      <br>
           
<h4>5) Using LD_PRELOAD</h4>
      This is another option. Developed by Chris Maison at <a
 href="http://www.r00t3d.org.uk/">http://www.r00t3d.org.uk/</a> Linux SocksCap
   v0.1.1 <a
 href="http://www.r00t3d.org.uk/bin/sockscap-0.1.1-linux.tar.gz">sockscap-0.1.1-linux.tar.gz</a><br>
      <br>
      Extract the sockscap.so library and place somewhere on your system. 
 It  does  not really matter where you put it, but /usr/local/lib is usually 
 a  good starting place. Load up a Socks 5 server or run a Bouncer running
in Socks 5 mode or  alternatively   have a Socks 5 server running on another
machine. You will need to type the following two commands in to enable it:<br>
      <br>
      export LD_PRELOAD=/usr/local/lib/sockscap.so (Different if you placed 
 it  elsewhere)<br>
      export SOCKS_PROXY="127.0.0.1:1080" (Or your alternative Socks 5 server)<br>
      <br>
       Then (hopefully) all connections you make will go through the Socks
 5  server.   To see which connections are being sent to the Socks 5 server
 then  check  syslog as it will output a single line status message on success.
 To enable  it for an application just make sure you export the two symbols
 beforehand.   BUT.. DO NOT export the symbols before loading the Socks 5
server otherwise  it will get stuck in a loop.  To disable it run the following
command:<br>
      <br>
      unset LD_PRELOAD<br>
      <br>
      Suid binaries will not run with LD_PRELOAD which means they will not
 get  sent through the proxy, unless you export LD_PRELOAD as root and run
 the suid binary as root.  This is because LD_PRELOAD could be used to create 
 a wrapper for the open() call and use that as a backdoor to gain root on 
the machine. ??Also, static built binaries will not evaluate LD_PRELOAD  either 
 as they will not attempt to dynamically load libraries and that defeats 
the object of static.<br>
      <br>
      This looks very promising despite the low version number. Some infomation
  quoted from Chris Maison's site.<br>

<h4> Misc.</h4>
             NEC never replied to any of my emails so I think it is best
to  not   bother    them anymore, there are enough solutions now anyway.<br>
