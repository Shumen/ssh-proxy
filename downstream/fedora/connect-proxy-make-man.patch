+.SH "DESCRIPTION" 
+.PP 
+\fBconnect-proxy\fR open connection over SOCKS4/5 proxies 
+.PP 
+Please, note that any HTTP-Proxy tunnel won't work with content-inspection firewall (unless using SSL). 
+.SH "OPTIONS" 
+.IP "\fB-H\fP" 10 
+specifies a hostname and port number of the http proxy  
+server to relay. If port is omitted, 80 is used. You can specify this 
+value in the environment variable HTTP_PROXY and pass the \-h option 
+to use it. 
+.IP "\fB-S\fP" 10 
+specifies the hostname and port number of the SOCKS 
+server to relay.  Like \-H, port number can be omitted and the default 
+is 1080. You can also specify this value pair in the environment 
+variable SOCKS5_SERVER and give the \-s option to use it. 
+.IP "\fB-4\fP" 10 
+specifies SOCKS relaying and indicates protocol version to use.  
+It is valid only when used with '\-s' or '\-S'.  
+Default is '\-5' (protocol version 5) 
+.IP "\fB-R\fP" 10 
+method to resolve the 
+hostname. Three keywords ("local", "remote", "both") or dot-notation 
+IP address are acceptable.  The keyword "both" means, "Try local 
+first, then remote". If a dot-notation IP address is specified, use 
+this host as nameserver. The default is "remote" for SOCKS5 or 
+"local" for others. On SOCKS4 protocol, remote resolving method 
+("remote" and "both") requires protocol 4a supported server. 
+.IP "\fB-p\fP" 10 
+will forward a local TCP port instead of using the 
+standard input and output. 
+.IP "\fB-P\fP" 10 
+same to '\-p' except keep remote session. The 
+program repeats waiting the port with holding remote session without 
+disconnecting. To connect the remote session, send EOF to stdin or 
+kill the program. 
+.IP "\fB-w\fP" 10 
+timeout in seconds for making connection with TARGET host. 
+.IP "\fB-d\fP" 10 
+used for debug. If you fail to connect, use this and check request to and response from server. 
+.SH "USAGE" 
+.PP 
+To use proxy, this example is for SOCKS5 connection to connect to 
+'host' at port 25 via SOCKS5 server on 'firewall' host. 
+ 
+\fBconnect-proxy \-S firewall host 25\fR  
+ 
+\fBSOCKS5_SERVER=firewall; export SOCKS5_SERVER;  
+connect-proxy \-s host 25\fR 
+.PP 
+For a HTTP-PROXY connection: 
+ 
+\fBconnect-proxy \-H proxy-server:8080  host 25\fR   
+ 
+\fBHTTP_PROXY=proxy-server:8080; export HTTP_PROXY;  
+connect-proxy \-h host 25\fR  
+.PP 
+To forward a local port, for example to use ssh: 
+ 
+\fBconnect-proxy \-H proxy-server:8080  host 22 \fR  
+\fBssh \-l user \-p 5550 localhost\fR 
+.PP 
+To use it along ssh transparently: 
+\fB # file://~/.ssh/config 
+Host * 
+ProxyCommand connect-proxy \-H proxy-server:8080  %h %p\fR
